# Testing Strategy for Tasks App Backend

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the testing strategy for the Tasks App Backend. The approach ensures that all critical components of the application are thoroughly tested, from individual units to the entire system.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Tests
Unit tests verify the correctness of individual components in isolation.

**What we test:**
- Controllers
- Models
- Middleware functions
- Helper functions

**Tools used:**
- Jest as the testing framework
- Mocks for dependencies

### 2. Integration Tests
Integration tests verify that different components work together correctly.

**What we test:**
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- Authentication flow
- Error handling

**Tools used:**
- Supertest for API testing
- In-memory database for testing

### 3. System Tests
System tests verify the behavior of the entire application as a whole.

**What we test:**
- End-to-end workflows
- Authentication and authorization
- Data persistence
- Error scenarios

### 4. Performance Tests
Performance tests verify that the application meets performance requirements.

**What we test:**
- Response time
- Throughput
- Error rate under load
- Resource usage

**Tools used:**
- k6 for load testing

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```

```

## Test Automation

### Continuous Integration
Tests are automatically run on:
- Every commit to main branch
- Pull requests
- Release builds

### Test Coverage
We aim for high test coverage:
- Controllers: 90%+
- Models: 90%+
- Middleware: 85%+
- Helpers: 90%+
- Routes: 80%+

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Keep tests focused on a single behavior
- Use descriptive test names
- Avoid test interdependence
- Clean up test data after execution

### Mock External Dependencies
- Database (use in-memory database)
- External APIs
- Native modules (like bcrypt)

### Maintainability
- Modularize test code
- Use helper functions for common tasks
- Keep test files organized by component or feature
- Document non-obvious test scenarios

## Test Environment

We maintain multiple test environments:
- Local development: Runs on developer machines
- CI environment: Runs in the CI pipeline
- Staging: Production-like environment for system tests

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures:
- High code quality
- Early detection of defects
- Confidence in code changes
- Performance under load
- Maintainability

Remember that tests are also code that needs to be maintained. Write clean, readable tests that serve as documentation for the application's behavior.
